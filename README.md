# CalCalc

## Introduction
CalCalc __(Calories Calculator)__ is an Augmented Reality Application that allow users to scan food items and obtain nutritional information (calorie count, proteins, fats, etc), benefits as well as exercise options for burning calories. The users can visualize everything, from food items to information provided, through 3D digital objects.

## The Problem
- The limitation with the majority of existing apps is that they do not provide nutritional information regarding Indian cuisine, due to which Indian users have to rely on the
internet for the same for each food item.
- Many times, users can't discover a specific food item on the app, and there are just a few apps that offer food scanning functionality, which is paid.

## Product Features
The following features are offered by the app:
- 2D food image scanning functionality
- Creation of 3D digital model of the scanned food item
- Display of all the related information in AR
  - Calories, carbs, fats, and proteins of the scanned food item.
  - Duration of cycling/walking/running for burning the consumed calories.
  - A “More Info” button for viewing the merits/demerits of that food.
- A “UI” button to hide/show UI canvas.
- A “Quit” button to quit the application.
- Display of a warning message if the app is made to work in low light.
- Implementation of gesture recognition to scale and rotate the 3D model.
